The model results shown for a given date and time are a 100-minute "hindcast" of thermospheric neutral density calculated using input data 100 minutes prior to the timestamp. The valid model altitude range is 250--600 km above mean sea level (AMSL).

The Karman model was developed by Trillium Technologies as part of the Frontier Development Laboratory with support from the Heliophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate. The visualization shown here was developed by the University of Colorado Boulder Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center (SWx TREC) in collaboration with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP).
