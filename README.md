Karman is a machine learning Python package for thermospheric density modelling. It was developed as a collaboration between the Heliophysics Division of NASA and [Trillium Technologies](https://trillium.tech/) under a NASA-funded Sole Source project. Its main goal is to improve our understanding and modeling of thermospheric density variations due to the Sun's influence.
