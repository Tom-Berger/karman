Karman Reference Documentation
================================

Karman is a machine learning Python package for data-driven thermospheric
density modeling. Its main goal is to improve our understanding and
modeling of thermospheric density variations due to the Sun's influence.
Furthermore, it also has the objective to provide a shared framework where
people can design, train and benchmark their own thermospheric density
models.

The documentation is currently a work in progress.
